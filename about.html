                      I did my undergraduate degree in Physics with Medical Physics at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-physics-biomedical-engineering/" target="_blank">University College London</a> (graduated 2016).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Then, I did a doctorate at the <a href="https://www.win.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank">Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging</a> at the University of Oxford, where I worked in the Physics Group on developing novel MRI acquisition and reconstruction methods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I worked with sparsity based reconstruction methods for highly undersampled dynamic arterial spin labelling angiography. You can find my thesis <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:cb910147-d567-4e00-8e7b-626674a38743" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    <p>
                      I was supervised by <a href="https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/thomas-okell" target="_blank">Dr Tom Okell</a>, <a href="https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/mark-chiew" target="_blank">Dr Mark Chiew</a>, and <a href="https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/peter-jezzard" target="_blank">Prof Peter Jezzard</a> and had funding from the <a href="https://epsrc.ukri.org" target="_blank">Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</a> through the <a href="http://www.onbicdt.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank">Oxford-Nottingham Biomedical Imaging Centre for Doctoral Training</a>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After finishing, I did a short postdoc in my DPhil lab to keep developing and expanding the methods I worked on during my DPhil. And then I moved to my current postdoctoral lab, the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/setsompoplab.html" target="_blank">Setsompop Lab</a> at Stanford University.

                      I like trying new hobbies and sports. In the past I have done sports like horse riding, football, modern pentathlon, and kendo, but when I went to university I started rowing and coxing and that has been my main sport for the last eight years in the UK. I just love being out on the water! We shall see what my next sport shall be here in California!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      At Oxford I was actively involved in my <a href="https://wolfsonrowing.org" target="_blank">college rowing team</a> and acted as President 2018-2019 when the club celebrated its 50th anniversary. That year my crew, the women's first team, rose to Head of the River in the annual Oxford College competition, Summer Eights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Apart from sports, I also enjoy the arts, and love going to museums, plays, and especially musicals.
                      I like reading and I am trying to revive my passion for reading, and for that I am keeping a reading list <a href="booklist.html">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One of my newest interests is in Effective Altruism, a movement that focuses on doing the most good in the world. This idea has prompted me to reflect on my own life and work, and I am actively considering how my career can be best used for helping the world. Some of the books on my <a href="booklist.html">reading list</a> are related to this topic. I was also involved in the creation of a <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DcNB2Z2tKLe6migqk/why-scientific-research-is-less-effective-in-producing-value" target="_blank">blog post</a> that highlights some inefficiencies in academia that hinders global progress. This is an area I would like to explore more.
